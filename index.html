            <p>Chef John declares, “At some point this summer, you’ll get tired of grilled chicken. Any grilled chicken. No matter the marinade, or the delivery system, you will have simply reached your limit, and that’s when you need to reach for the chorizo.” While we agree that Chef John’s recipe for chicken and chorizo skewers is a delicious choice, we take exception to his claim—because these winning recipes have us fired up to grill chicken all summer long. </p>
            <h2>Good Frickin- Paprika Chicken - Ingredients</h2>
            <p>6 tablespoons plain yogurt</p>
            <p>3 cloves garlic, crushed</p>
            <p>3 tablespoons ground paprika</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
            <p>1 tablespoon hot chilli paste such as sambal oelek</p>
            <p>1 pinch cayenne pepper</p>
            <p>1 (5 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</p>
            <p>1/4 cup olive oil</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</p>
            <p>1 tablespoon ketchup</p>
            <p>1/8 teaspoon hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek)</p>
            <p>1 pinch paprika</p>
            <p> salt and pepper to taste</p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
            <p>Whisk together yogurt, garlic, 3 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon hot chile paste, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
            <p>Mix in chicken pieces and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours. </p>
            <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
            <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
            <p>Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Season with salt.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
            <p>Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, sherry vinegar, ketchup, 1/8 teaspoon hot chile paste, pinch paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
            <p>Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 4 minutes with grill lid closed.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
            <p>Turn chicken and grill with lid closed until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</p>
            <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
            <p>Spoon sherry vinegar mixture over cooked chicken and serve.</p>
            <p><strong>final step</strong></p>
            <p>add some carrots, turnip and soup stock and you got a stew going baby!</p>
